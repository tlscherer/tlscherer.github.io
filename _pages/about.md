I strive to be an academic-practitioner in peace and conflict. I am currently the Deputy Director of the [Center for Peace and Security Studies (cPASS)](http://cpass.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego. 

My research focuses on measurement and data quality in violence and conflict. I am currently working on extracting event data from international crises narratives (see the [ArXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07081)). 

I currently have contract projects on research quality with the US Institute of Peace and the National Institute of Justice. I am an Academic Fellow at [fp21](https://www.fp21.org/).
