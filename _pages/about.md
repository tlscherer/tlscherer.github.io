I strive to be an academic-practitioner in peace and conflict. I am currently the Deputy Director of the [Center for Peace and Security Studies (cPASS)](http://cpass.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego. 

Much of my work centers around questions of peacekeeping and foreign intervention. I am also interested in global emergency response, gender and conflict, and the micro-dynamics of war.
