The [ICB Project](https://sites.duke.edu/icbdata/) has data and narratives of 476 crises from 1918 - 2015 (version 12). Each crisis is an entry in the system level dataset with an accompanying 500-word narrative.

CPASS has turned the narratives into a sequenced-events dataset. Substantively, this transformation allows us to examine the sequencing of crises; methodologically, we can use this dataset to explore qualitative-quantitative data transformations and as a test case for the use of machine-learning on narratives.
