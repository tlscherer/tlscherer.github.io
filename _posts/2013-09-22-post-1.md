I like work in OneNote to keep things organized, but moving text to other platforms can run into some formatting issues.  Here's my self-guide for moving a OneNote page to html for this wordpress blog.

<!--more-->

<ol>
	<li>Save as a Single File Web Page (*.mht)</li>
	<li>Open the page in a web browser (I use Internet Explorer)</li>
	<li>View source of the page</li>
	<li>Copy this into your Wordpress post using the text tab for html code</li>
</ol>
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">For me the transition adds annoying line breaks.  You can fix this by going through line by line, or do the following.</span>
<ol>
	<li>Copy the html into Word</li>
	<li>As a place holder, do a find replace and replace ^p^p as some other unused symbol pattern (###)</li>
	<li>now find replace ^p with a space</li>
	<li>finally, replace your symbol pattern to ^p</li>
</ol>
This process works pretty well, but I'd love to hear if you found another shortcut.
