When the OECD released their [2015 Fragility Report](http://www.oecd.org/dac/states-of-fragility-2015-9789264227699-en.htm) I remember looking at the penta-Venn Diagram of the different states of fragility and wondering why Afghanistan was not fragile in institutions, which was supposed to capture corruption among other governance issues. This question eventually led to a [Monkey Cage post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/17/the-oecds-fragility-index-is-surprisingly-fragile-and-difficult-to-reproduce/) on my attempt to replicate their measures of fragility.

The OECD responded in a comment to the initial posting pointing out some problems with my replication while admitting certain errors. However, after a revised replication that incorporates those edits, [all up on Github](https://github.com/tlscherer/OECD-States-of-Fragility-2015-Replication/blob/master/ReassessmentResults/StatesofFragility2015reassessment.pdf), I still get very different results. 

I look forward to seeing OECD's 2016 report as they have [discussed some interesting revisions](http://oecdinsights.org/2015/06/14/crowd-sourcing-models-of-fragility/) to their measure of fragility. Hopefully along with substantive improvements they will also incorporate improve their methodology especially by way of transparency. As the OECD continues to work with this data in order to provide a public good, the greatest good will come from being as public as possible.
